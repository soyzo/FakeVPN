# FakeVPN
This webpage displays a message recommending a VPN and includes interactive elements like a vibration effect, clickable buttons, and icons. It prevents users from leaving easily by blocking the back button and showing a warning when they try to close the page. Instead of redirecting to a link, it now just shows an alert as an example.
